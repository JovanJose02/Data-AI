# Final Reflection & Key Takeaways:
"""
I noticed that there was a lot of missing data in my dataset, so I used row deletion imputation
BECAUSE the remaining data was sufficient and complete-case analysis avoided bias from poor estimation.

I began by cleaning and standardizing the data, then explored it through boxplots and violin plots,
which revealed gender-based performance trends — males slightly excel in math, while females
outperform in reading and writing.

A correlation heatmap showed strong links between reading and writing scores, implying that
language-related skills are interconnected. This was visually confirmed using a scatter plot
with a regression line of best fit, which showed a strong positive linear trend. The regression
line's equation and R² value quantified this relationship, and a summary box on the plot displayed
the means and standard deviations for both reading and writing scores. Females generally occupied
the higher end of both axes, reinforcing earlier observations.

When I visualized total and average scores, I observed a near-normal distribution with a few low outliers.

Parental education and test preparation were key factors — students with higher-educated parents
or who completed test prep scored noticeably better, suggesting socioeconomic and preparatory
influences on academic success.

A pie chart showed a fairly balanced gender distribution, ensuring fair model evaluation.

I used Label Encoding BECAUSE I needed to convert categorical variables into numerical form,
and created a binary target classifying students as above or below average BECAUSE it simplifies
the classification problem.

I used train/test splitting BECAUSE it provides an unbiased performance estimate on unseen data,
and trained a Random Forest Classifier BECAUSE of its robustness and ability to handle both numeric
and categorical features.

To improve performance, I used GridSearchCV BECAUSE it systematically tuned model hyperparameters
for optimal accuracy. I also performed cross-validation BECAUSE it provides a reliable, generalized
performance estimate across folds. 

I tested multiple models including Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost BECAUSE comparing performance
ensures I select the most effective algorithm for the task.

Finally, I applied SHAP values to interpret my Random Forest model BECAUSE it explains individual feature
influences and enhances model transparency.

The feature importance plot confirmed that subject scores were the most predictive, but test prep
and parental education also contributed meaningfully.

Overall, this project demonstrated the critical role of exploratory data analysis, visualization,
model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretability in understanding educational outcomes
and building trustworthy predictive tools.
